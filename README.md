# Auto-RedstoneMusic
This is the code used for generate Redstone Music

You can see my first Redstone Music in bilibili:https://www.bilibili.com/video/av68558277

That vedio was fully handmade( with a little help of mcedit), which was readlly exhausting

So after that, I began to consider about doing it automatically

What's the different between my code and Note Block Studio?

Well...

For now, the code only works on my computer.

Because it requires a csv file, my personal piano resourcepack and a basic redstone music track in minecraft.

But for the next stage, it will be easier to use for everyone( not really ～(￣▽￣～)~ )

红石音乐，每个音点过去太累了，命令方块也得一个个写。。于是就写了个代码用于生成函数文件，放到MC里直接调用就行咯

不过我还没测试过hhhh，应该问题不大~

BTW，我还是想把项目名称改成：让猪猪也能做红石音乐！
