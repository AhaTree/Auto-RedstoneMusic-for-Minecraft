# Auto-RedstoneMusic
This is the code used for generate Redstone Music

You can see my first Redstone Music in bilibili:https://www.bilibili.com/video/av68558277

That vedio was fully handmade( with a little help of mcedit), which was readlly exhausting

So after that, I began to consider about doing it automatically

For now, the code only works on my computer.

Because it requires a csv file and a basic redstone music track in minecraft.

But for the next stage, it will be easier to use for everyone( not really ～(￣▽￣～)~ )
